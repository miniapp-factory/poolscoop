+Code the following app
+```
+Idea: A "New Pair Explorer" for DEXs (Decentralized Exchanges) to find newly created pools.
+User Goal: Be the first to find new meme coins or utility tokens before they pump (High Risk).
+Core Features (MVP):
+
+* Listen to "PairCreated" events on Uniswap/PancakeSwap factories.
+* Filter by: Initial Liquidity > $X, Token Name, Renounced Ownership (basic check).
+* Link to the verified contract on Etherscan/BscScan.
+* "HoneyPot" check integration (using third-party API).
+
+Development Plan:
+
+1. Use libraries like Ethers.js or Viem to connect to RPC nodes (ETH, BSC, Base).
+2. Set up an event listener for Factory contracts.
+3. Build a live-feed UI (scrolling list of new pairs).
+4. Integrate a quick security check API (e.g., GoPlus or HoneyPot.is).
+5. Add sound alerts for new pairs matching filters.
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.
