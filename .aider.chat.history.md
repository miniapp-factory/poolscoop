```
Idea: A "New Pair Explorer" for DEXs (Decentralized Exchanges) to find newly created pools.
User Goal: Be the first to find new meme coins or utility tokens before they pump (High Risk).
Core Features (MVP):

* Listen to "PairCreated" events on Uniswap/PancakeSwap factories.
* Filter by: Initial Liquidity > $X, Token Name, Renounced Ownership (basic check).
* Link to the verified contract on Etherscan/BscScan.
* "HoneyPot" check integration (using third-party API).

Development Plan:

1. Use libraries like Ethers.js or Viem to connect to RPC nodes (ETH, BSC, Base).
2. Set up an event listener for Factory contracts.
3. Build a live-feed UI (scrolling list of new pairs).
4. Integrate a quick security check API (e.g., GoPlus or HoneyPot.is).
5. Add sound alerts for new pairs matching filters.
```

Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.

A stylized magnifying glass hovering over a pair of coins, one green and one blue, set against a dark, circuit-patterned background. The magnifying glass highlights the coins, symbolizing discovery of new liquidity pools on decentralized exchanges. Neon accents and subtle digital network motifs give the image a modern, techy feel, while the overall composition conveys a sense of exploration and high-risk opportunity.
